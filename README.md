# AutoArchaeologist

A Python Toolchest to dissect historic data media. 

The fundamental problem is how to explore the data from ancient and rare
computers, in a convenient and user-friendly way.

The AutoArchaeologist is a framework where plugins can be written to take
apart and present old data media, in a browser-friendly fashion.

## Getting started

To get a feel for how this works and ensure you've got everything set up,
we've included a sample file that can be excavated as an example:

```sh
python3 run_example.py
```

When you're ready to for further and process you own images use `run.py`.

## Using run.py

The various utilities that allow the extraction and processing of data are
designed to be composed into an Excavation that can be run against binary
images of disks and other media. Some standard excavations have been put
together in bundles ad exposed via a single `run` command.

Performing an exavation of a file is as simple as the following:

```sh
python3 run.py --excavator <excavator> <filename>
```

Usage information including the list of excavatos that are avalable as well as
other options will be output when running without arguments: `python3 run.py`.

# First Example: Commodore CBM900 Harddisk

Our first historic use of the AutoArchaeologist is now online:

https://datamuseum.dk/aa/cbm900

This is the harddisk from datamuseum.dk's rare and running Commodore CBM-900
UNIX computer (https://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Commodore/CBM900)

In this case, the code in `unix/v7_filesystem.py` recognizes this as a little
endian Version 7 unix filesystem, and creates artifacts for the individual
files in the filesystem.

The `generic/ascii.py` code spots which files are text files, and thus we can
see how few fortunes, the CBM-900 came with, back in 1984:

# Second Example: RegneCentralen GIER computer

The paper-tapes from this computer, like many other of 1950-1960
vintage, are not in ASCII but in a per-model, and in some cases,
per-installation character set.  The one on GIER isnt too bad
(https://datamuseum.dk/wiki/GIER/Flexowriter) but did cause a bit
of headache before we got a good HTML representation of overprinting
underlines and the "10" glyph.

GIER is of course the computer Peter Naur of Backus-Naur-Notatation
fame worked on, and his demonstration program is a good example of the output:

# Third Example: Regnecentralen RC3600/RC7000

RC7000 was a Data General Nova with a "RC7000" sticker, RC3600 was
Regnecentralens own reimplementation, and they were as a sort of swiss
army-knife computer doing everything from industrial control and monitoring,
to teaching programming in high-schools.

We have a rich software archive for these computers, and making sense
of them requires quite a number of "examiners".

Here is a saved COMAL program (https://datamuseum.dk/wiki/COMAL) to
solve second degree equations, written by a high-school student in 1981:
